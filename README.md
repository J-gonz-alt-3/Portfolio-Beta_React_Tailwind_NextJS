# Reasons for Beta version of Portfolio Project

So, you will notice that it looks quite different from my current live Portfolio (jpgcodes.com).

The reason for this project was to use Next.JS in combination with TailwindsCSS to see just how different it is from ReactJS.

It was also a requirement (final project), that I needed to complete to obtain the Responsive Design Certification.

For the certification version of this project, I was only allowed to use HTML and CSS, no React or JS.

For the certification version of this project, link is here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jpgcodes/responsive-web-design

So, technically there's two versions of this same webpage, one with NextJS and one without!

# My thoughts on NextJS

My honest opinion is that I enjoyed the project during the actual development process however deployment of my NextJS app has been quite annoying.

Originally, I wanted to deploy it on Hostinger but realized that I couldn't do it the same way as I did with the other webapps I've deployed.

Sooo I looked online and found that the best way to deploy Next.JS apps is via Vercel!

But heres the thing, I already bought a Hostinger domain for this webapp so I didn't want it to go to waste so I Googled a bit more and discovered that I could point my domain to Vercel by simply changing the DNS servers on my Hostinger domain to point to Vercel.

Which while it did take a couple of hours to take effect, it now works!

So, jokes on you Hostinger, I was able to use my domain!

# Lessons Learned

I feel like my Tailwind and even overall CSS skills really skyrocketed/improved with the completion of this project.

I feel as if I now have a much stronger grasp of CSS/Tailwinds, perhaps it's due to the fact that I've now completed a large number of projects.

Regardless, I might my preference is TailwindCSS over vanilla CSS!

Also I think I might stick with ReactJS over NextJS just because deployment is so much easier but I haven't decided.

Anyways, thanks for reading this and looking at my code!

************************************************************************************************************

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
