# Reasons for Beta version of Portfolio Project

So, you will notice that it looks quite different from my current live Portfolio (jpgcodes.com).

The reason for this project was to use Next.JS in combination with TailwindsCSS to see just how different it is from ReactJS.

My honest opinion is that I enjoyed the project during the development process however deployment has been quite annoying.

Originally, I wanted to deploy it on Hostinger but realized that I couldn't do so and the best way to deploy Next.JS apps on via Vercel.

I then discovered that Vercel may be able to point the deployed App to a domain of mine, so I pointed my Hostinger domain's DNS servers to Vercel and I am currently waiting to see if this works.

If not then I lost $8 dollars :/

# Lessons Learned

My Tailwind and even CSS skills really skyrocketed with this project.

I feel as if I now have a much stronger grasp of CSS/Tailwinds perhaps it could also be due to the number of projects I am putting under my belt.

Regardless, I might stick with ReactJS just because deployment is so much easier but I haven't decided.

Anyways, thanks for reading this and looking at my code!

************************************************************************************************************


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
